## 1. What You Need Besides the Kit

| Item | Quantity |
| ---- | -------- |
| Keycaps | 31 |
| Key switches | 31 |
| USB-C cable | 1 |
| Precision screwdriver | 1 |
| Pliers | 1 |

### Key Switch Compatibility

Mejiro31 only supports low-profile key switches.

By default, only Cherry MX-compatible [Gateron low-profile 3.0](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0FJXBL4BF) switches work without soldering.

If you want to use the Kailh Choc V2 series, you need to solder [sockets for Kailh Choc](https://shop.yushakobo.jp/products/a01ps?variant=37665172553889).

### Recommended Key Switches

Here are some recommended switches for your reference.

| Switch | Feature | Actuation | Soldering |
| ------ | ------- | --------- | --------- |
| [Gateron low-profile 3.0](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0FJXBL4BF) | Standard feel | 50~43g | Not required |
| [Nuphy Gateron low-profile 3.0](https://sanyollc.com/products/nuphy-gateron-low-profile-3-0-switches) | POM material | 45~37g | Not required |
| [Lofree Hades POM](https://lofree.co.jp/products/hades-low-profile-pom-switches) | Silent | 40g | Required |
| [Kailh Saker mini](https://shop.talpkeyboard.com/products/kailh-saker-chocv2-linear) | Short travel | 37g | Required |
| [Kailh Choc v2 Panda V1](https://ja.aliexpress.com/item/1005008329710988.html) | Lightweight | 30g | Required |
| [Kailh Choc V1 Pink](https://shop.yushakobo.jp/products/pg1350?variant=44079245754599) | Lightest | 20g | Required |

## 3. Assembly

Download the firmware file first.

After downloading, hold the BOOT button on the PCB while connecting it to your PC.

![](./imgs/build_firmware.jpeg)

When it appears as a drive, drag and drop the downloaded file onto it.

Once the drive automatically ejects, you are ready. (Depending on your PC settings, you might see a warning; you can ignore it.)

After flashing the firmware, start assembling.

Use pliers to remove the extra tabs from the PCB.

![](./imgs/build_trimming_top_middle.jpeg)

It should look like this after trimming.

Next, fit the PCB into the top plate.

![](./imgs/build_direction_pcb.jpeg)

![](./imgs/build_fits_pcb.jpeg)

Make sure the pillars on the top plate align snugly with the holes on the PCB.

![](./imgs/build_zoom_pcb.jpeg)

Next, place the foam plate so the PCB components sit into its cutouts.

![](./imgs/build_turning_foam.jpeg)

Press the foam in firmly so it does not sit higher than the surrounding walls.

![](./imgs/build_put_foam.jpeg)

Place the bottom plate on top so that the countersunk screw holes are visible.

![](./imgs/build_put_bottom.jpeg)

Tighten the six screws.

(Press the foam down slightly while turning each screw. Stop once it becomes slightly resistant; overtightening can strip the holes and prevent the screws from holding.)

Stick the six rubber feet on.

The base of the keyboard is now complete.

Install the two stabilizers in their positions.

Next, install the key switches. Align the pins with the holes before pressing them in.

Attach the keycaps.

All done!

## 4. Troubleshooting

- A key does not respond.

Check if the switch pins are bent. If they are, straighten them with tweezers or needle-nose pliers. Scratches on the PCB can also cause issues, so handle it carefully.

- Screw holes feel loose.

You can narrow the holes with masking tape. In some cases, you may need to replace the top plate.

- A part broke or went missing.

Some parts and PCBs may be available individually. Please see [Contact Us](#5-contact-us).

- Other issues

There might be a soldering error. Please reach out via [Contact Us](#5-contact-us).
